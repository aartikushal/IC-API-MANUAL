# 📖 API Manual Helper

The **API Manual Helper** is an intelligent assistant designed to make API documentation more accessible and interactive. Instead of manually searching through large API manuals, users can query the bot in **natural language** and receive contextual answers.  

It integrates **n8n** for workflow automation, **Pinecone** for vector search, **OpenAI models** for semantic understanding, and **Telegram** as the chat interface.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🔎 **Semantic Search on API Docs** – Ask questions like *“How do I authenticate requests?”* and get direct answers.  
- 📂 **Google Drive Integration** – Store and manage your API manuals in a shared knowledge base.  
- ⚡ **OpenAI Embeddings + Chat Model** – Provides context-aware answers in plain English.  
- 🔗 **n8n Workflow** – Automates query → search → answer → response pipeline.  
- 💬 **Telegram Bot Interface** – Users can ask queries directly in Telegram.  
- 📌 **Step-by-step Guides** – Extracts relevant parts of the API manual and explains usage.
